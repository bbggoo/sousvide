Most of The code origin by author list below,Thank for their great job!

3.1 Max31865

origin by  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-max31865-rtd-pt100-amplifier/python-circuitpython

3.2 web interface

origin by https://hackaday.io/project/153281-super-accurate-sousvide-on-a-budget,

and I add conn.php as a connnection string,every php file read connnection string,you don't need modified each file.

add mysql.sql ,also fix some bug. 

Just dowload zip file,unzip to your web server root directory. In linux ,you may need chmod a+x for php files.

Run mysql.sql in phpmyadmin will create a database.Edit conn.php to fit your envirment.

Test passed with php 7.3 , Apache 2.4.29 ,mysql 8.04 ,windows 7 professional x64.

3.3 pid liberary

origin by https://github.com/hirschmann/pid-autotune ,it is the best pid liberary i haver ever seen

version 0.2 in progress
chinese display utility GT20L16S1Y chinese font chip ,https://www.cnblogs.com/katachi/p/9629565.html abandened,just use http://wk20.cn/?t=118
 
Using more simple sh1106 oled driver, https://www.cnblogs.com/katachi/p/9629565.html replace by https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples/tree/master/i2c/1106oled

Rotary Encoder(https://github.com/MikeTeachman/micropython-rotary) not comptible with uasync, https://github.com/SpotlightKid/micropython-stm-lib/blob/master/encoder/encoder.py  instead
